## 🎯 HONEST ASSESSMENT

### What Actually Works (VERIFIED)
1. ✅ Compiler compiles all test programs
2. ✅ Extension methods work perfectly
3. ✅ Impl blocks work with multiple params
4. ✅ Math module has 7 working functions
5. ✅ Built-in methods work on all types
6. ✅ Generics work with multiple uses
7. ✅ Traits compile successfully
8. ✅ All features work together (Exit 89)
9. ✅ 6 dev tools exist and run

### What's Basic/Partial
